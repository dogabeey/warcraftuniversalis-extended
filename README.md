# warcraftuniversalis-extended
An event extension for EU4's warcraft universalis mod. Mod's Original creator is **vawser**.

EU4's warcraft universalis mod is great. But I always felt like It could be more eventful. 
This extension adds more decisions and events to countries to increase immersion & add a lil more "evil" like Old Gods, 
Legion Invasion for Fel religions & more.

#### Supports warcraft universalis' current version, 1.22

## Current Features

* Decisions to summon Old Gods for certain countries when certain conditions met, and Decisions for "good" countries to kill them. Curently all Old Gods except Y'shaarj are summonable.

* Countries who owns The Icecrown Citadel can wear Lich King's Crown to control The Scourge.

## Planned Features


* A quest for Fel followers to retrieve Sargerite Keystone and open the way for The Burning Legion.

* Adventurer "Raids" against certain zones.
